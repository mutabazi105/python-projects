    "## 1.1 Why SOLID Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID principles address common problems in software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem | Without SOLID | With SOLID |\n",
    "|---------|--------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Rigid code** | Changes ripple through entire codebase | Changes are localized |\n",
    "| **Fragile code** | Fixing one bug creates others | Components are isolated |\n",
    "| **Immobile code** | Code can't be reused elsewhere | Components are portable |\n",
    "| **Viscous code** | Doing things right is harder than hacking | Good design is natural |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**💸 Cost:** Studies show that 80% of software costs come from maintenance, not initial development. SOLID reduces maintenance costs by making code easier to understand and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⏱️ Time:** Teams following SOLID principles report faster feature development after initial investment, because existing code doesn't fight against changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🐛 Quality:** Isolated, focused classes are easier to test thoroughly, leading to fewer bugs in production.\n",

    "### Dependency Injection Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to inject dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Example | When to Use |\n",
    "|---------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Constructor injection** | `Service(db: Database)` | Required dependencies |\n",
    "| **Setter injection** | `service.set_db(db)` | Optional dependencies |\n",
    "| **Method injection** | `service.run(db: Database)` | Per-call dependencies |\n",
    "| **Interface injection** | Implement `DatabaseAware` | Framework-managed |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor Injection (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class OrderService:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, \n",
    "                 repo: OrderRepository,      # Required\n",
    "                 notifier: Notifier,         # Required\n",
    "                 logger: Logger | None = None):  # Optional\n",
    "        self.repo = repo\n",
    "        self.notifier = notifier\n",
    "        self.logger = logger or NullLogger()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Dependencies are explicit\n",
    "- Object is fully initialized after construction\n",
    "- Easy to see what a class needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dependency Inversion \"Onion\"\n",
    "\n",
    "DIP creates layers where inner layers don't know about outer layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│           External (Frameworks)          │\n",
    "│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐    │\n",
    "│  │      Infrastructure (DB, API)   │    │\n",

    "Arrows point INWARD: Outer layers depend on inner layers\n",
    "Inner layers define interfaces; outer layers implement them\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common DIP Anti-Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |\n",
    "|--------------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| **Service Locator** | Hidden dependencies | Constructor injection |\n",
    "| **Static dependencies** | `Database.get_connection()` | Inject instance |\n",
    "| **`new` inside methods** | `self.db = MySQLDatabase()` | Inject through constructor |\n",
    "| **Concrete parameter types** | `def save(mysql: MySQLDatabase)` | Use abstract type |\n",
