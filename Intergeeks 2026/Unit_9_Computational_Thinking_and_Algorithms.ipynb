    "## 1. What is Computational Thinking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming isn't just about syntax; it's about **solving problems**. Computational thinking is the thought process involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution in a way that a computer can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Key Insight**: Computational thinking is a skill that transfers beyond programming – it helps in any field where you need to solve complex problems systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four pillars of computational thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 1.1 Decomposition\n",
    "Breaking a complex problem down into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: Large problems are overwhelming. Small problems are solvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Complex Problem | Decomposed Into |\n",
    "|----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Build a \"Snake\" game | Draw the board → Move the snake → Detect collisions → Generate food → Track score |\n",
    "| Analyze sales data | Load data → Clean data → Calculate metrics → Visualize trends → Generate report |\n",
    "| Create a website | Design layout → Build navigation → Create pages → Add interactivity → Deploy |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 1.2 Pattern Recognition\n",
    "Looking for similarities among and within problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: Recognizing patterns means you can reuse solutions and predict outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Example*: \"Calculating the sum of a list\" and \"calculating the average of a list\" both share the pattern of *iterating through elements and accumulating a value*.\n",
    "*   *Example*: User authentication in different apps follows the same pattern: collect credentials → validate → grant/deny access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 1.3 Abstraction\n",
    "Focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: Abstraction lets us manage complexity by hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Example*: When sorting students by grade, we only care about the *grade* attribute. We abstract away their eye color or home address.\n",
    "*   *Example*: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals (abstraction) without understanding the engine mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 1.4 Algorithms\n",
    "Developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: An algorithm is a precise, repeatable solution that a computer can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Example*: A recipe for baking a cake is an algorithm.\n",
    "*   *Example*: Google Maps finding the shortest route uses sophisticated algorithms."
